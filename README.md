# Do You Wanna A Pizza?
#JSLABEXPERIMENTS
----------
⛔ Hmm, it seems that the project has not been finished... But don't worry, on the 22nd it will be ready ⛔

Hasn't it happened to you that you want to order a pizza, just to talk to the manager, but you can't because you don't have money? Not me, and it has nothing to do with it, that's why I made this "PIZZAS ORDER 3000".


Now seriously, I did this as a project to refresh things from the past (and yes, I didn't remember anything), all that seemed cool to me, and for that, I want to share it with you

⛔ The project is under development. I want to make it 5 stages, and I will upload each one every week to my github, and repl. (It should be noted that in "I-teractive learning X", it will only be available after the 5 stages have been completed) ⛔
